# Project.me-2.0

This is a re-upload of a re-done personal website with better styling and an Express backend. Previously the backend had been written in pure node.js. I wanted to try my hand at reinventing the wheel, and thinking about things like routing and file handling at the lowest level (at least, the lowest level in node). The original project can also be found here on GitHub.
This version features improved styling, better css architecture, Express for handling requests (instead of raw node), and an AJAX submitting form which triggers a route that automatically emails me the contents of that form. (Previously I had just been inspecting logs!)
